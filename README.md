https://www.codewars.com/kata/array-leaders-array-series-number-3


An element is leader if it is greater than The Sum all the elements to its right side.

Given an array/list [] of integers , Find all the LEADERS in the array.


Notes

Array/list size is at least 3 .
Array/list's numbers Will be mixture of positives , negatives and zeros
Repeatition of numbers in the array/list could occur.
Returned Array/list should store the leading numbers in the same order in the original array/list .

```
    arrayLeaders ({1, 2, 3, 4, 0}) ==> return {4}
```


Kata Niveau 6: Array combinations

In this Kata, you will be given an array of arrays and your task will be to return the number of unique arrays that can be formed by picking exactly one element from each subarray.

```
    For example: solve([[1,2],[4],[5,6]]) = 4, because it results in only 4 possiblites. 
    They are [1,4,5],[1,4,6],[2,4,5],[2,4,6].
```
Make sure that you don't count duplicates; for example solve([[1,2],[4,4],[5,6,6]]) = 4, since the extra outcomes are just duplicates.
